A runnable solution to the 2021 AP CS A Exam FRQ #3
## Notes:

* I added a few extra methods to the `Level` and `Game` classes to facilitate the creation and running of the `Driver` class.
* There are two methods in the main method of class `Driver`:
    * PartA() - will run the portion that creates and populates the club members.
    * PartB() - will run the removeMembers method and then print the grads and remaing club members.
