# AP CS A - 2021 - FRQ #3
A runnable solution to the 2021 AP CS A Exam FRQ #3
## Notes:

* I added code to make the entire FRQ runnable.
* There are two methods in the main method of class `Driver`:
    * PartA() - will run the portion that creates and populates the club members.
    * PartB() - will run the removeMembers method and then print the grads and remaing club members.
